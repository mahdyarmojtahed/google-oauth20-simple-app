Configure Passport authenticated session persistence :

In order to restore authentication state across HTTP requests, Passport needs
to serialize users into and deserialize users out of the session.  In a
production-quality application, this would typically be as simple as
supplying the user ID when serializing, and querying the user record by ID
from the database when deserializing.  However, due to the fact that this
example does not have a database, the complete Google profile is serialized
and deserialized.
